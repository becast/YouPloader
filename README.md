# YouTube has changed their site and made YouPloader unable to monetize videos with the hacky way it did before since YouTube has not enabled the API to set these kind of things. Since the program also lost it's use for me the active developement has ceased.
# Feel free to fork! If you want to take over you can message me.


# YouPloader

YouPloader is an Java based, multi platform YouTube uploader aiming to make uploads convenient and manageable.
Inspired by the “Simple Java YouTube Uploader” by Dennis Fischer, which is no longer maintained and relies on Java 7 to work, I set out to create a spiritual successor to this nifty program.
YouPloader is released under the MIT Licence.
Currently YouPloader is in beta and the first releases have been published!
